// Don't worry about being DRY when writing tests
// Better to make them extra clear!! AHA - Avoid Hasty Abstractions
// For example, if you have the same setup (Arrange) steps for a few different tests, you might think to refactor those into a helper function. That would be good logic for application code, but not here! We want to keep each test as independent and self-contained as possible. We're going for coverage and rigor here, not DRYness.

test("App component renders", () => {
    // do test things:
    // Arrange
    console.log("Hi mom!");
    // Act

    // Assert
})
